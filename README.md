# Markdown Command Line Syntax Highlight
Small utility to highlight markdown text in terminal. NOTE: This is a work in progress not ready to be used or seen

# Usage
```sh
$ cat README.md | md
```

# TODO
* `--no-color` to avoid highlight
* `--no-delimiters` to avoid delimiters characters
* `--toc` to show only headers
* `--file=<PATH>` to take input from file
* `--configuration=<PATH>` to take configuration file from another place from `~/.md` or `~/.markdown`
* configure the highlight of every syntax element
* configure the character to be used as delimiter in every syntax element
